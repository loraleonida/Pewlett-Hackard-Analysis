# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Helping Pewlett-Hackard create an employee database and perform employee research analysis using SQL to determine who will be retiring in the next few years, how many positions will they need to fill, and the specific job titles they will need to hire for. This analysis will help the company look ahead and prepare accordingly for when those eligible for retirement begin to retire.

## Results
- There biggest area of retirees is the "Senior Engineer" and "Senior Staff" positions. Those are very experienced roles.
- The smallest area of retirees is the "Manager" and "Assistant Engineer" positions.
- There are a total of 72,458 employees retiring in the "silver tsunami".
- There are only 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program.


## Summary

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  - There are 72,458 roles that need to be filled.

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  - No, there are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation. There are only 1,549 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program and that is not nearly enough to cover the number of positions the retirees will be leaving.

If you were to open up the eligibility for the employee mentorship program to those not just born in 1965, but those born between January 1, 1961 and December 31, 1965, then you would have more than enough qualified employees to mentor the next generation. If you opened the mentorship program to those dates, there would be 75,319 eligible employees to fill mentorship roles.


This code block and table shows the titles of the eligible employees between 1961 and 1965. The count of employees in each title is very similar to the count of retirees in each title. You would have enough mentors to cover the positions Senior Staff, Senior Engineer, Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer, and Manager. The only positions you wouldn't have enough mentors to match the future employees would be the positions Engineer and Staff.
